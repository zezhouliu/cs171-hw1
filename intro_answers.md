1) If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

We could improve the display of the table by adding a summary section on top of the table that includes several significant data points (i.e. the min, max, mean, etc).  We could also include a visual by adding a boxplot that graphically displays the significant data points in order to better convey the information.  

2) Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.
    
    2a) Population Reference Bureau.  
        - Link: http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/world-map.aspx#/table/population
        - Reasons why it's better: The tabular data displays the world's population in a useful way because there are several categories (region, 2011 population, 2050 estimate, natural increase %, and 2050 population as a multiple of 2011) that can be selected as a filter to sort the data.  
        Specific table rows that are of particular importance (like categories) are highlighted with a different background color.  It also lets you filter out specific regions around the world, and even let you select to view the data as a map alongside the table.  
        The map is colorfully labeled and also has additional options to selectively view the data.

    2b) United Nation World Food Programme
        - Link: http://cdn.wfp.org/hungermap/
        - Reasons why it's better: Similar to the previous example, this website uses a creative way to display their tabular data in an interactive and clear way.  
        Instead of simply displaying the data in a table, the main view of the webpage is a large interactive map, while the table is displayed on a sidepanel that dynamically changes as you select different options.  
        In this case, you can select none, one, or many different flags around the map that will aggregate the data from the different regions and then display on the side-panel.  
        Moreover, on the side-panel, there are selective tabs that you can choose in order to separate the related information.  
        For example, one tab has the general description of the hunger levels in the specific areas, another has the specific values and numbers associated with the data, etc.  
        
    2c) Olympic Medal Results
        - Link: http://www.olympic.org/olympic-results
        - Reasons why it's better:  On the splash page, you can choose to see the olympic games results by filtering by games, sports, or event.  
        You can also choose to search for medalist by athlete name, country, or the olympic games (year/location).  
        When you select your criteria, the page then renders the associated results, with your filters still located at the top of the page for convenient changing, and then below in the body there's a table that clearly displays the results of the search.  
        What's cool about this page is that on the side, there are some photos that show the actual event and links to a slideshow and video of the event.  
        Near the bottom, there is a record evolution graph for the event, showing the evolution of the world records for the corresponding event as a graph over time.  
        There are also several other tables that show like semi-final results, etc.
