1. What's missing? Is this bar chart usable in its current form?
2. What is the role of each of the three nested levels of `g` elements? (keep in mind you'll be adding a title to the chart)
3. Complete the implementation section below. Is there any consequence if you add the `text` elements before or after the `rect` elements? Why?
